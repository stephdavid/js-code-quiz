## Module 6 Challenge - Working with Web APIs: Code Quiz

Challenge - build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions which will use dynamically updated HTML and CSS from JavaScript code and have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

### Process

* To start, I've created and cloned a GitHub repo, and started writing this README

* As of this Sunday morning (Nov 26), I haven't yet worked out the logic. I think that creating the "building blocks", i.e. the set of questions from the extracted frames of the gif image, might be helpful in doing this.

* As well, I'll set up the file structure, creating a folder and adding 3 js files, and sketching out an initial static html page to determine where the generated pieces will go.
